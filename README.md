# Sanke Water Gun Game

Snake Water Gun is a famous two-player game many people play. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. here I have implemented this game using C programming.

### This project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer.
Following are the rules of the game:

##### 1.Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
##### 2.Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
##### 3.Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.
##### 4. In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
